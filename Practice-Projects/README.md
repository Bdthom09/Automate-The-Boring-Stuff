This folder contains all of the practice problems except for a couple. I did not include
a solution to 'Controlling Your Computer Through Email' for a couple of reasons.
I did not want to download BitTorrent and Al Sweigart already has a good example 
of this program on http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/. I also currently do not 
have a solution for 'Extending and Fixing the Chapter Project Programs'. In fact,
I'm having trouble with the original that is given in the chapter. I plan on 
starting from scratch with this program to see if I can figure out a solution. Once
and if I do, I'll upload it here.

Even though there are solutions to most of the practice problems here, I urge you
to try and do them yourself. I would be lying if I said I didn't struggle while
working through most of these. But you need to learn to struggle and figure out
how to solve solutions yourself. I first tried everything I could for each program,
then I googled solutions or tried to find examples, then I would ask for help
on www.reddit.com/r/learnpython. As a programmer, you will probably always have
access to Google, so there is no shame in searching for an answer. But I would
still try and figure it out on your own before resorting to that. 

I've added my files I used for the word invitations and seating cards in 
GithubFiles.zip.
