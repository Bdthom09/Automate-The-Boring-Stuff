# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff
A collection of solutions for Automate The Boring Stuff with extra programs to make your progress through the book easier

Automate The Boring Stuff With Python is a book written by Al Sweigart. It can be found online at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ or you can make a donation and/or purchase the book at https://nostarch.com/automatestuff or Amazon. 

This book is designed for people new to programming that aims to achieve success in writing programs that can be used for your daily life. Throughout each chapter, Swiegart assigns practice projects to complete. I have completed all but one of these practice projects and published them for view.

>A note about my codes. There are definitely better way to achieve the same results than what I'm providing. I did my best to use material learned from only the book to keep things familiar. Some chapters are outdated and the modules used now require different syntax. I tried my best to point out these changes in the codes, but I apologize if I missed any. Chapter 12 works with Excel files and openpyxyl and I noticed most of the changes here. If you try any of my codes and they are not working for some reason please let me know. I'd be happy to figure out what the issue us and update the code to accomadate any new versions.

>I have also filled my codes with a lot of comments. I tried my best to explain what is happening and WHY I did something. I didn't go into that much detail about explaining how the code works since the book does that. But putting everything together may make it easier. If you were to actually publish code like this most of the comments should be removed. 

>Last, I am not a professional programmer. I've taken one Intro class in college and the rest is self taught. So I apologize for any mistakes I have made. I have tried my best to follow PEP 8 guidelines when writing these codes. Feel free to leave me with comments/suggestions on anything you see here.

Comments about the book:
This was the first book I used when learning Python and I highly recommend it. I had little programming experience before with one Intro C++ class and self taught R. Progamming languages are similar, but can also be very different for each one. Automate The Boring Stuff uses IDLE as the main source of writing code. While not needed, I HIGHLY suggest using an IDE, especially if you are new to programming. It will help you prevent making mistakes as well as trying to learn PEP 8 guidelines as you go. For this book I used IntelliJ, Pycharm, Notepad++ and Atom. My favorite IDE is Pycharm and my favorite text editor is Atom. However, search for something that fits your needs. 

I would like to keep this repository updated at all times. If you run into a code that is no longer working due to a version update please let me know. I'd be happy to update it.
